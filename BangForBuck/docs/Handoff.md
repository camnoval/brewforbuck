## 2026-08-27 — Capture flow live on device; results editable; OCR hardened

*Supersedes the notes below re: current state and next step.*

**State:** the app runs end-to-end on device. Point the camera (or pick from the library) → Apple
**Vision** OCR (`VisionTextRecognizer` behind `TextRecognizer`) → `LineAssembler` reassembles rows
(and now **columns**) → `MenuParser` → `MenuSession` → a ranked, **editable** list behind a 21+ gate.
Estimates are one-tap correctable, prices are editable, priceless/low-confidence lines sit in a **"Not
sure about these"** bucket, and the user can **add a drink the scan missed** or **remove** a misread
one. Results now show the menu price alongside a clearly-labelled per-standard-drink cost, with a
formulas explainer.

**Verify (engine):** `cd Core && swift test` — now also covers `LineAssembler` column detection,
`MenuParser` name-cleanup + `drafts`/`cans` headers, the editable `MenuSession`, and manual add/remove.
**Run (app):** build `AppTarget` in Xcode against the local `Core` package; needs
`NSCameraUsageDescription` in `Info.plist`. iOS 16 target.

**R1 status:** OCR is materially better — two-column layouts split correctly and item names are clean.
Still bounded v1: genuine 3+ column or free-form layouts fall back to fewer columns, and the manual
add/edit path remains the safety net. Tunable knob if rows merge/over-split on a specific photo:
`LineAssembler.lines(rowToleranceFraction:)` (default 0.5).

**Next — monetization (Week 2):** RevenueCat `remove_ads` IAP + RevenueCat Ads, implemented in
`AppTarget/Infrastructure/` behind the existing `PurchaseController` / `AdPresenter` contracts — no
`CoreServices` change. Owner-only setup first: App Store Connect record, RevenueCat project +
`remove_ads` product, ad-network alcohol-policy check (R3). Then the App Store listing (informational
price-comparison framing, 21+ gate already in place) and submission with a resubmit buffer (R5).

**Icon:** iOS uses a 1024×1024 PNG in `Assets.xcassets/AppIcon` (single-size), not `.ico` — flatten
any alpha before shipping (App Store rejects alpha).

---

## 2026-08-25 — Phase 5 + demo app landed (end-to-end)

*Supersedes the notes below re: current state and next step.*

**State:** the pure value engine is complete — `MenuParser` → `ABVEstimator`/`SizeEstimator` →
`ValueRanker`, assembled by `MenuPipeline` (`[String] → MenuAnalysis`). A minimal SwiftUI **demo
app** in `AppTarget/` runs that pipeline on bundled sample menus and shows the ranking, provenance
notes, and the needsPrice / excluded-non-alcoholic buckets — runnable on device via
`AppTarget/HOW_TO_RUN.md` (no camera yet).

**Verify (engine):** `cd Core && swift test`. **Run (app):** follow `AppTarget/HOW_TO_RUN.md`.

**Parser is bounded v1 (R1).** It handles the common menu shapes (see `MenuParserTests`), not every
layout; the manual add/edit path is the intended safety net for misreads.

**Next — the real capture flow (Week 1):** `VisionTextRecognizer` implementing `TextRecognizer`
(`VNRecognizeTextRequest`, on-device), a camera/photo picker, the **21+ gate** (R3), and inline
correction that promotes an estimate to `.read` and re-ranks. The engine doesn't change — only the
source of the OCR lines. Then monetization (Week 2): RevenueCat `remove_ads` + RevenueCat Ads behind
the existing `PurchaseController`/`AdPresenter` contracts.

---

## 2026-08-25 — Phase 4 landed (ValueRanker)

*Supersedes the notes below re: current state and next step.*

**State:** `ValueRanker` (CoreServices) computes standard-drinks-per-dollar (v1) and
calories-per-dollar (v2) and sorts best-first, taking `[PricedDrink]`. The doc's worked example is a
test. The whole value engine is now provable headless: brand/style/fallback knowledge → priced,
alcoholic drinks → ranking.

**Verify:** `cd Core && swift test`.

**Next (Phase 5 — parser + estimators):** the section-state `MenuParser` (Change A: header-priced
sections), `ABVEstimator`/`SizeEstimator` wiring `StaticBeverageKnowledge` (read-if-printed, else
estimate), the `needsPrice` split, and the description-line suppression (Finding 4). Designed against
`Tooling/Fixtures/` + a Vision-noise pass (real OCR is messy, per your note). This is the last pure
phase; after it the value engine is end-to-end from OCR lines to a ranked list, still with no UI.

---

## 2026-08-25 — Brand table added (data-driven, 161 brands)

*Supersedes nothing structural; extends Phase 3.*

Brand data now lives in `Tooling/Data/beverages.json` (script-readable) and is codegen'd to
`GeneratedBrandTable.swift` by `Tooling/generate_brand_table.sh`. Lookup order is now **brand →
style → category fallback**, each flagged via `EstimateSource` (`.brandMatch` / `.styleChart` /
`.categoryFallback` / `.unclassifiedFallback`). To change the data: edit the JSON, run the generator,
`swift test`.

---

## 2026-08-25 — Phase 3 landed (CoreContracts + sourced knowledge)

*Supersedes the notes below re: current state and next step.*

**State:** four protocols in `CoreContracts` (Foundation-free), the sourced `StaticBeverageKnowledge`
(style chart → category fallback, flagged by `EstimateSource`), and test doubles. New `CoreContractsTests`
target. Data provenance is documented in `docs/BeverageDataSources.md`.

**Design note (per your ask):** ABV/size are sourced (NIAAA + BJCP/Wine Folly), and the app is honest
about confidence — `.styleChart(matched:)` when a style/varietal matched, `.categoryFallback` when it
didn't. The menu's printed value still wins over both.

**Verify:** `cd Core && swift test` — now includes `CoreContractsTests`.

**Next (Phase 4 — ValueRanker):** the standard-drinks-per-dollar metric + sort, taking `[PricedDrink]`,
with the worked-example test and the price-invariant test (§8). No photos needed.

**Then Phase 5 (parser + estimators):** wires `StaticBeverageKnowledge` into `ABVEstimator`/`SizeEstimator`
and adds the section-state `MenuParser` (Change A), designed against the fixtures + a Vision-noise pass.

---

## 2026-08-25 — Phase 2 landed (CoreModel spine)

*Supersedes the notes below re: current state and next step.*

**State:** the spine is built in `Core/Sources/CoreModel` — `Provenance<T>`, `Price`, `Volume`,
`BeverageCategory`, `MenuItem`, `DrinkOption`, `PricedDrink`, `RankedDrink`, `ValueMetric` — with
`CoreModelTests` mirroring it 1:1. Two invariants are now enforced by type:
- **Price (§10):** non-positive/absent amounts can't make a `Price`; `DrinkOption.price` is
  non-optional, so a priceless line can't become a rankable drink.
- **Change B:** `PricedDrink.init?` rejects `.nonAlcoholic` — a priced mocktail can't be ranked.

The value *formulas* are deliberately NOT in the model — they land in `ValueRanker` (Phase 4).

**Verify:** `cd Core && swift test` on your Mac (I can't run Swift in my environment).

**Next (Phase 3 — CoreContracts):** the four protocols (`TextRecognizer`, `BeverageKnowledge`,
`PurchaseController`, `AdPresenter`) + a pure `StaticBeverageKnowledge` seeded from
INSPECTION_FINDINGS §Finding 3, and a `FakeTextRecognizer` test double.

**Still waiting:** nothing blocking Phases 3–4. Phase 5 (parser) will use the fixtures + a
Vision-noise pass (per your note that real input is on-device OCR, not clean transcription).

---

## 2026-08-25 — §5 inspection done; two design changes folded in

*Supersedes the Phase-1 note below only re: the Phase 2/5 plan (adds Changes A & B).*

16 real menus transcribed to `Tooling/Fixtures/` (`INSPECTION_FINDINGS.md` has the full
write-up). R1's main input is now real, not remembered. Two changes to carry forward:

- **Change A (Phase 5):** `MenuParser` is a **section-state machine**, not a per-line map —
  some menus price only on the section header (Rullo's `Elixirs | $14`). Still pure/testable.
- **Change B (Phase 2):** add `.nonAlcoholic` to `BeverageCategory`; those items are dropped
  before ranking (they have a price, so the price invariant won't catch them). Everything
  else in the spine is unchanged.

Also confirmed printed ABV/size is common (beer/wine), so the `.read` path is well-used.
**Next unchanged:** Phase 2 (CoreModel) — now including the `.nonAlcoholic` case.

---

## 2026-08-25 — Phase 1 landed (scaffolding + doc set)

*Supersedes nothing (first note).*

**State:** repo skeleton is up, laid out by layer/role (§3). `Core` SPM package compiles and
`swift test` is green on placeholder sources. Full §2 doc set exists. `.gitignore` and the
`run_checks` gate are in place. The two authored design docs (`Architecture.md`,
`ProjectConventions.md`) are placed verbatim in `docs/`.

**Environment note:** the value engine is being generated as source to build on a Mac (and
`swift test` runs on plain Linux since `Core` is framework-free). No Xcode/iOS SDK was used
to produce it.

**Next (Phase 2 — CoreModel):** implement the spine — `Provenance<T>`, `Volume`,
`BeverageCategory`, `MenuItem`, `DrinkOption`, `PricedDrink`, `RankedDrink`, `ValueMetric`
— with `CoreModelTests`. Then Phase 3 (contracts), Phase 4 (ValueRanker + metric).

**Blocked / waiting:** **Phase 5 (MenuParser + estimators) needs real menu photos** to
transcribe into `Tooling/Fixtures/` (§5, R1). Upload them any time before we reach Phase 5;
Phases 2–4 don't need them.

**Open decisions deferred to Week 1:** AppTarget Xcode-project generation approach
(`.xcodeproj` vs XcodeGen/Tuist vs SPM-app); min iOS version; then account actions only the
owner can do — App Store Connect record, RevenueCat project + `remove_ads` product, Devpost
registration.

**Naming:** canonical name is `BangForBuck` (per the design doc); "brewforbuck" is the
marketing tagline from the original README.

## Recipes — "how to add a new ___" (§14)

### Add a new ranking metric (the one you'll reuse — Architecture §14)
1. Add a case to `ValueMetric` (e.g. `.caloriesPerDollar`).
2. Add the pure formula to `ValueRanker` (it already has `pure_ethanol_floz`).
3. Add a `ValueRankerTests` case with a worked example.
4. Add a segmented toggle in the Results feature. **No other layer changes.**

### Add / swap an external dependency (OCR engine, purchase backend, ad network)
1. It already has a protocol in `CoreContracts`. Write one new type conforming to it in
   `AppTarget/Infrastructure/` (§6).
2. Inject the real conformer at app startup; inject a fake in tests.
3. No `CoreServices` change — the core depends on the protocol, never the concrete impl.
